"""Mirror BoneForge N-panel panels into the Properties editor.

v3.0.20: All BoneForge panels are also registered as sub-panels under
the Properties editor's Armature data tab.  The mirror appears only
when an armature is the active object, giving riggers the option to
work from the Properties editor without duplicating draw code.

How it works:
  After every phase has registered its original `BF_PT_*` panels, we
  walk `bpy.types` looking for panels whose ``bl_space_type == 'VIEW_3D'``
  and ``bl_category == 'BoneForge'``.  For each one, we
  dynamically synthesise a sibling class that shares the original's
  ``draw`` (and ``draw_header``/``poll`` if present) but lives in the
  Properties editor's Armature-data context.  Sub-panel relationships
  (``bl_parent_id``) are remapped onto the mirror ids so children
  nest correctly.

The mirror classes are tracked in a module-level list so
``unregister`` can reverse the process cleanly.
