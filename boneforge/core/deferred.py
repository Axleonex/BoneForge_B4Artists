"""Deferred-mutation operator pattern (v3.3.0).

Operators that mutate Blender's registration state — register_class,
unregister_class, addon enable/disable, anything that touches bpy.types
class slots — cannot do that work directly inside ``execute``. The
operator's own class instance is on the call stack; tearing it down
mid-call causes a use-after-free in Blender's C++ layer, which
manifests as a hard segfault.

The official Blender pattern is to schedule the dangerous work via
``bpy.app.timers.register``. The timer callback runs AFTER the operator
returns and its class instance has been GC'd, so by the time the
mutation happens, no operator is on the stack.

This module exposes:

* :func:`schedule_after` — thin wrapper that catches & logs exceptions
  inside the deferred callback so a single failure can't disable the
  timer dispatcher.
* :class:`DeferredMutationOperator` — base class for any operator that
  needs to mutate registration state. Subclasses override
  ``_deferred_work(args)`` as a ``@staticmethod`` that does NOT touch
  ``self``. ``execute`` always returns ``{'FINISHED'}`` immediately.

    *func* must accept zero args. Returning ``None`` runs the callback
    once; returning a float schedules a re-fire at that interval (rare
    in practice — most BoneForge use cases are one-shot).

    Errors raised inside *func* are caught + logged, NEVER propagated.
    Letting an exception escape the timer dispatcher silently disables
    the timer system for the whole Blender session — a foot-gun we do
