"""BoneForge install / uninstall / reload lifecycle helpers.

The problem this module solves: Bforartists / Blender does not actually
unload Python modules when an add-on is uninstalled or replaced. The
new install extracts files on disk but the *running* interpreter still
holds the old module objects in ``sys.modules``, the old class
registrations on ``bpy.types``, and the old compiled bytecode in every
``__pycache__/*.pyc`` next to the source. The result is the
all-too-familiar "I installed the new version but Blender keeps acting
like it's the old one" — which is what the user has been hitting.

What this module does (and what it does NOT do):

* Cleanly tear down every BoneForge class registration on
  ``bpy.types``.
* Strip every Scene-level property whose name starts with the
  BoneForge prefix.
* Purge every ``boneforge.*`` entry from ``sys.modules`` so the next
  ``import boneforge`` actually re-reads from disk.
* Walk the install directory and delete ``__pycache__`` so stale
  ``.pyc`` files cannot mask new ``.py`` source.
* DOES NOT delete user data — custom properties on objects, meshes,
  bones, the scene, or saved blend files are left alone. The Auto-Rig
  session, taskboard tasks, and per-object boneforge_* keys persist
  across reload.

These helpers are used in three places:

* ``boneforge.__init__.register()`` — runs the stale-module purge on
  startup so a freshly installed BoneForge over a still-loaded older
  copy actually takes effect.
* ``boneforge.__init__.unregister()`` — runs the property + class
  scrub so the next ``register()`` starts from a clean slate.
* ``BF_OT_ReloadBoneForge`` operator — user-facing, surfaced as a
  button in the add-on preferences. One click reloads the entire
  add-on without restarting Blender.
