"""BoneForge core — draw function registry.

Phase modules register their panel-drawing functions here at
registration time. Other modules retrieve them by key, avoiding
any direct cross-module imports within a phase.

This keeps the architectural rule intact: modules never import
from each other's internals, only from boneforge.core.
