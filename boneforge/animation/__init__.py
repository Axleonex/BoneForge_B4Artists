"""BoneForge -- Animation Workflow.

Lives next to ``ui_panels`` but is concerned with *animating* an
existing rig rather than presenting it: pose snapshots, F-Curve
tools, Rigify-specific helpers, and corrective shape keys driven by
bone rotation.

Sub-modules
-----------
``pose_library``     Disk-backed pose library (a thin layer over
                     Blender's Asset Browser data) so a single rig
                     can carry its own pose set without depending on
                     the global asset library.
``graph_tools``      Graph Editor + Dope Sheet utilities -- snap
                     handles, set tangents in bulk, scrub easing.
``rigify_enhance``   IK/FK match, snap-to-bone, switch limbs --
                     wraps the Rigify rig_ui add-on with a panel
                     that looks consistent across Rigify versions.
``correctives``      Corrective shape keys driven by a bone's local
                     rotation. Drivers are wired automatically; the
                     UI exposes a "Sculpt at this pose" workflow.

Disabled in this release (kept on disk for re-enable):
``anim_layers`` -- removed in v3.0.16 because Blender's NLA already
covers the workflow.
``tween``       -- removed in v3.0.26 because the Dope Sheet's
                  breakdown / blend-to-neighbour keys cover it.
